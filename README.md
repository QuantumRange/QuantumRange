## About Me

I primarly worked with **Java** since ~2017 and switched to use **Kotlin** since 2023.
I sometimes program in **Cpp** since ~2021.
I also looked at **Rust** and hope to make some bigger projects with it.

You can reach me on Discord: `QuantumRange#0354` *(`@quantumrange`)*, but I would prefer [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) **`@quantumrange:matrix.org`**.

*Unfortunately, I had to make most of my projects private because my younger self loved to push creds and private information. Only my newer projects are sometimes public.*

```cpp
int main() {
    for (long* i = 0; std::intptr_t(i) < INT64_MAX; ++i) {
        *i = 0;
    }

    return 0;
}

```
